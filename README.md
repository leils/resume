# This is not my resume

It's a repository of code that I've started using to lay out my resume.

I got tired of updating my resume in InDesign then Illustrator then Sketch, so I decided to do it with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [react-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/).

If you want to see my resume in all its dynamically rendered glory, it's over [here](https://paulmandel-resume.web.app/).

If you want to see how I'm generating the resume, feel free to have a look around. And if you like the format and want to steal it, feel free to [fork](https://github.com/paulmand3l/resume/fork) it.
